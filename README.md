sudolikeaboss(https://github.com/ravenac95/sudolikeaboss) replacement.

sudolikeaboss is a 1Password utility to interact with iTerm2 and type in your passwords for you. 

This code talks directly to your 1Password local vault(SQLite data file) and works with 1Password > 6.8.0. Tested up to 6.8.3 so far - but should be pretty stable to new versions. File an issue if you run into issues.

Currently only the python version works, see src/python/README.md (https://github.com/peacetara/slab/blob/master/src/python/README.md)

I plan to eventually re-write this in Rust or maybe Go, but I'm still learning those languages, and I needed a replacement *NOW*.  re-writes accepted as pull-requests! :)
