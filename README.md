sudolikeaboss(https://github.com/ravenac95/sudolikeaboss) replacement.

sudolikeaboss is a 1Password utility to interact with iTerm2 and type in your passwords for you. 

This code talks directly to your 1Password local vault(SQLite data file) and should work with 1Password > 6.8.0

Currently only the python version runs, see src/python/README.md

I plan to eventually re-write this in Rust or maybe Go, but I'm still learning those languages, and I needed a replacement *NOW*. :)
